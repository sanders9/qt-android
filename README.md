# qt-android

This repository is a tutorial explaining how to integrate Qt in an Android Studio project. The main purpose is to create and retrieve data from a native sqlite3 database using Qt5Sql and Qt5Core. This last one will allow us to use the signals and slots features implemented in the Qt framework

Throughout this project I will explain the different folders located in this repository 

**Note : People interested about this project must be familiar with Android Studio, the Qt framework and the Android SDK and NDK**

##1. the *libs/* folder

##2. the *src/main/java/* folder

##3. the *src/main/jni/* folder
